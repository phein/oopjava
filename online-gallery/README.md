# Lab 2 & Homework 2

## Abstract

For lab and homework two you'll carry out the design and
implementation of a class hierarchy from scratch.

## The Problem

The following problem comes from [How to Design Classes](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/htdc.html) (pg 140):

>...Develop a program that creates an on-line gallery from three
> different kinds of records: images (gif), texts (txt), and sounds
> (mp3). All have names for source files and sizes (number of
> bytes). Images also include information about the height, the
> width, and the quality of the image. Texts specify the number of
> lines needed for visual representation. Sounds include information
> about the playing time of the recording, given in seconds.
> 
> Develop the following methods for this program:
> 
> - `timeToDownload`, which computes how long it takes to download a file at some given network connection speed (in bytes per second);
> - `smallerThan`, which determines whether the file is smaller than some given maximum size;
> - `sameName`, which determines whether the name of a file is the same as some given name.

## Lab 2

Your goal for lab is to complete the UML class hierarchy diagram and
then begin declaring, documenting and stubbing all the classes and
interfaces. Show the diagram to the instructor before you leave, and
create a pull request for the code.

## Homework 2

For homework you should complete the tests and implementation of your
class hierarchy. Create a new pull request to submit.
